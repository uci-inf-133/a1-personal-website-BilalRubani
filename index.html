          <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
          <p>
              Hello! I am in my final year as a Software Engineering Student at UC Irvine. My career goal
              is to work for an organization that prides itself on serving others, as my purpose of being
              a software engineer revolves around contributing in a positive way to society. I've built up
              my skills through my undergraduate journey, as well as embarking on side-projects and working
              an internship as well. I am currently looking for full-time roles that will help me achieve my
              goal. Thanks for viewing my Portfolio!
